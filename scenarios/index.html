            <strong>Context: </strong>
            Singapore MRT system.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Description: </strong>
            Our Singapore Mrt System has grown rather complicated over the past few years. It is also well known that transport systems can be modelled by graphs. Hence some people might be interested in the 'connectivity" of our mrt system, that is, the number of possible distinct acyclic paths are there between 2 stations (only limited to the 4 main lines, ignore the LRTs)? (may be interesting for people planning their trips to school from home, can also be useful for alternative path if one day the mrt breaks down).

            Possible extension is to print the path out.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Algorithms involved (if any): </strong>
            BFS. We will have to teach them BFS and probably guide them on modeling this problem effectively. The idea is to focus on the Interchange stations on the 4 main lines.

            <p><strong>Description: </strong>The basic building blocks will be musical notes instead of graphical runes. The musical notes can be denoted by a string of alphabets with various operators, for example, concatenates two string of notes together, or have the student write a custom function that generates the next note based the previous ones.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Learning Objectives: </strong>The students are able to recreate particular melodies from a few basic blocks or create some of their own creations. Aspiring Skrillexes might try their hand at creating some electronic music.

              Given that certain modules have a certain grade distribution, given that you take it, select set of modules (with total MC = some amount) such that you maximize utility while keeping probability of getting a certain minimum CAP. We simply define modules to have a fixed utility and a certain grade distribution. Additionally we may define compulsory modules the student must take. Also, there may not be a solution.

              1 method of solving this problem would be instead of keeping track of GPA, we keep track of total points achieved by each module, this can be easily written as a probability distribution by “adding” the various components up. I believe at this point a greedy algorithm could be thought of.

              (idea shamelessly taken from <a href="http://allendowney.blogspot.sg/2012/01/think-complexity.html" target="_blank">here</a>.)
              There's a paper by Thomas Schelling called "Dynamic Models of Segregation", which proposes a simple model of racial segregation. Let's code our own model of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Description: </strong>The Schelling model of the city is an array of cells where each cell represents a house.  The houses are occupied by two kinds of agents, labeled red and blue, in roughly equal numbers.  About 10% of the houses are empty.
            </p>
            <p>At any point in time, an agent might be happy or unhappy, depending on the other agents in the neighborhood.  In one version of the model, agents are happy if they have at least two neighbors like themselves, and unhappy if they have one or zero.</p>
            <p>The simulation proceeds by choosing an agent at random and checking to see whether it is happy.  If so, nothing happens; if not, the agent chooses one of the unoccupied cells at random and moves.</p>

              In the United States, movie theatres work slightly differently. Your movie ticket doesn't contain a seat number, and this means that there are free seating in the movie theatre. In addition, after a movie has ended, there is no one to guide you to the exit. This means that after your movie has ended, you can *technically* slip into another movie theatre to watch another movie.

            <p>
              <strong>Context: </strong>
              The story happened when the Hebrews were slaves in Egypt and Moses was born. Pharaoh wanted all Hebrew baby boys be killed because he was afraid of them taking over his country when they grow up. To save Moses, his mother hid him in a basket by the side of the River Nile. Pharaoh's daughter found Moses in his basket when she came to the river to wash. She took him back to live with her as though he were her son. Later when Moses grew up, he saved helped the Hebrews escape from pharaoh’s torture.
            </p>

            <p>Moses grew up as an Egyptian prince, but he never forgot he was a Hebrew. One day Moses lost his temper and killed an Egyptian who had beaten a Hebrew slave to death. He had to run away to another land. God spoke to him from a burning bush and told him he must go back and free the Hebrews from slavery.</p>

            <p>Moses went to Pharaoh to ask him to set the Hebrews free. Pharaoh did not want to lose his slaves. Then ten plagues happened in Egypt. Before each one, Moses had warned Pharaoh what would happen. The disasters had been sent by God. The last plague was the worst. The eldest son in every Egyptian family, including Pharaoh's, died. God had warned Moses to mark the doorposts of all Hebrew houses so that Hebrew boys would be safe.</p>

            <p>Pharaoh was so upset by losing his son that he said the Hebrews could leave Egypt. The Hebrews knew they must leave Egypt quickly. They needed food to take with them. There was no time to let the bread rise before it was cooked. They had to take the dough as it was. Pharaoh changed his mind again and sent his army after them to bring them back.</p>

            <p>The army chased the Hebrews to the banks of the Red Sea. They would have been trapped but a miracle happened. God told Moses to lift up his rod and as he did so the waters parted to make a dry path. They were able to make their escape. When all the Hebrew were safely at the other shore, Moses lifted up his rod again and the waters of the sea closed on Pharaoh's army who had been chasing them.</p>

            <p>After being set free, they walked in the desert, seeking for the Promised Land Canaan. The journey was long and they soon ran out of food. They were very hungry and blamed Moses for taking them out of Egypt.</p>

            <p>God told Moses, "I will give the people food." The next day the ground was covered with a white food that tasted like honey (Moses called this food manna). God also sent flocks of birds called quails that they cooked and ate. When their water ran out, God told Moses to strike a rock with his rod. As he did so water rushed out and they all had enough to drink.</p>

            <p>After three months of travelling the Hebrews came to the foot of Mount Sinai. God called Moses to meet him on the mountain. As he climbed there was thunder and lightning. When he was up the mountain he was given ten laws that told the people how to live.</p>

            <p>These Ten Commandments were written on two tablets of stone. Moses stayed so long on the mountain that the people waiting at the foot of the mountain grew angry. They decided to make another God for themselves - a golden calf. When Moses returned he was shocked to see the people worshipping the golden calf. He broke the tablets God had given him and destroyed the golden calf. God forgave his people for worshipping the statue and told Moses to cut two more tablets of stone.</p>

            <p>Moses took the stone tablets up the mountain and God gave him the Ten Commandments again. When he came down all the people listened to Moses as he told them what God had said. Moses promised God that the Hebrews would keep all of the Commandments.</p>

              Gate assignment problem in an airport.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Description: </strong>
              After an aircraft has landed until the time when it departs again, the airport needs to take care of it by assigning a gate to it. Some work needs to be done during this time. For example, refueling the aircraft, unloading passengers, cleaning, providing new supplies and boarding new passengers. Given the schedules of all aircrafts and a set of gates, how can an airport robustly pair them without failing to meet a set of criteria?
            </p>
            
              The criteria may include:</p>
            <ul class="bullet">
              <li>One gate can only serve one aircraft at a time.</li>
              <li>Two adjacent gates cannot serve large aircraft at the same time.</li>
              <li>Some gates can only server certain types of aircraft.</li>
              <li>Two adjacent gates cannot server aircrafts with same departure time.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Also, a flight (aircraft) may have various properties:</p>
            <ul class="bullet">
              <li>Departure time</li>
              <li>Departure airport</li>
              <li>Arriving time</li>
              <li>Destination airport</li>
              <li>Type</li>
              <li>Size</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Same for a gate:</p>
            <ul class="bullet">
              <li>Types of flights it can handle</li>
              <li>Type</li>
              <li>Number, location etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              To achieve robustness, the goal is to maximize the idle time between all pairs of consecutive flights at a gate, ensuring that each flight can arrive either a bit too early or a bit too late without the need for re-planning the schedule. For example, a better solution to the following schedule is to move Flight 3 to Gate 2 and Flight 4 to Gate 1.

              <strong>Description: </strong>
              A similar scenario is taxi ordering and dispatching system. Based on the current taxi dispatch system in Singapore, there’re two categories of booking: current and advanced. Current bookings are requests for a taxi to reach a customer immediately or within 30mins. Currently it’s handled based on nearest-location method. A geographically nearest taxi is assigned to pick up the customer. Advanced bookings must be made over half an hour ago. Then the message is spread through out all taxis, both empty and occupied. The job is assigned to the taxi driver who first bid for it.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the way of handling current bookings is not always efficient. The taxis must take into account the current traffic condition. Therefore, the one with the shortest-time path should be selected. (Involves SSSP algorithm which may be a hard for freshmen.)
            </p>
            <p>
              To optimize advanced bookings handling, a taxi with a sequence of advanced booking pickup tasks should minimize the total travel cost, without violating precedence, capacity and time windows constraints (maximum amount of time to reach a customer). The problem can be modeled into Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Window (PDPTW). The idea is to chain several bookings with pick-up time points spread over a reasonable period of time and to let each pick-up point coincide with or be closed to the previous drop-off location.

              The three ingredients of the EdgeRank algorithm:
              <ol class="bullet">
                <li>Affinity Score (Activities and the people involved)</li>
                <li>Edge Weight (Type of activities)</li>

              <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/siri/" target="_blank">Siri</a>, the intelligent personal assistant for Apple's iOS is able to in a user's instructions, understand them and execute useful tasks for the user. Siri uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), an increasingly important branch of Computer Science to derive meaning out of a human's natural language input.

              <img src="http://images.apple.com/ios/siri/images/everyday_restaurants.jpg"/ class="inline">
              We will study one aspect of NLP, information extraction which is concerned about the extraction of semantic information from text. One common use-case is the scheduling of appointments and an instruction to do so can be: "Schedule a review meeting at Peter's office at 12.30pm tomorrow". Upon receiving this instruction, Siri has to identify the entities involved in this instruction:
              <ul class="block">
                <li><strong>Occasion: </strong>Review meeting</li>
                <li><strong>Time: </strong>12.30pm</li>
                <li><strong>Date: </strong>Tomorrow</li>
                <li><strong>Location: </strong>Peter's office</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              Other possible instructions:
              <ul class="bullet">
                <li><em>"On 5th June, I have an examination for CS1010S at MPSH1 at 9:00am"</em></li>
                <li><em>"Schedule a conference call with Phil tomorrow at 3PM"</em></li>
              </ul>
              Given a line of instructions, students can write algorithms to match the instructions with pre-defined patterns and aim to identify the entities involved accurately.
